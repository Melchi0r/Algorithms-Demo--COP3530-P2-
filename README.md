# Algorithms Demo (COP3530 P2)



*NOTE most of this is strictly recommended. You may be able to find other Os, Compiler, Libraries, IDE, etc that work with this.
*When I say recommended I mean that this is what I used to create it.

The recommended OS for this is Windows 10. 

The recommended IDE is Clion which can be found at https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/

When setting up Clion make sure to select all file types. (However this was made by using only .h and .cpp and CMakeLists.txt files)

The recommended Library is the C++ Standard Library & QT Framework.
The recommended compiler is GCCv5.3

They can both be downloaded via the QTOpensource installer found at https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea


When installing make sure you select Qt-QT5.9.0-MinGW 5.3.0, All QT-Qt5.9.0 framework packages, and QT-Tools-MinGW5.3.0

TO set up the CLion IDE (If you chose Clion)

	Go into File -> Settings -> Build,Execution,Deployment->Toolchains. (DO NOT go into Settings->Tools by mistake)

	Under Environment there will be a dropdown box. 

	Select from the list MinGW. Then to the right of this browse and select in your QT folder mingw530_32. (C:\Qt\Tools\mingw530_32 by default)

	You will know that you installed and selected it correctly if the CMake is Bundled, and the Make, C Compiler, and C++ Compiler are all detected and selected.

Now you are ready to run the program.

To run the program navigate to the main.cpp file after downloading the entire demonstration.

	Download at: https://github.com/Melchi0r/Algorithms-Demo--COP3530-P2-
	(Even include the "-" at the end)			

Then biuld and run the program from the main.cpp. (It will be the green play(left point triangle) in the top right if you use Clion).

Afterwards follow the instructions on the console at the bottom. (It usually skips to the end when it prints so as you run the program you may need to scroll up).
